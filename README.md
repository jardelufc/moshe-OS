My own custom Operating System. Tutorials: http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html and http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page

# Requirements
You need:

 1. Cygwin 32 bit (https://cygwin.com/install.html, remember to set the PATH variable properly);
 2. VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/);
 3. Cross compiler i586-elf-gcc for Windows (which **thankfully** can be found here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4286417/i586-elf-gcc-cross-compiler.rar. Don't forget to put him on C:\ and set the PATH var);
 4. dd.exe (also found on **tools/os-tools/dd/dd.exe**, put it on C:\ and set the PATH variable);
 5. ImDisk (found on **tools/os-tools/imdiskinst_2.0.0.exe** on this repo)
 6. Pacience (a lot of it)
